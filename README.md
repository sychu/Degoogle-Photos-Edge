# Degoogle-Photos

Unfuck the mess that Google Takeout makes of your photo library. Takes the dozens of chaotic zip archives, deduplicates, extracts dates, and organizes everything into clean `YYYY/MM/` folders with album symlinks and a browsable HTML report.

## About this fork

This is a fork of [couzteau/Degoogle-Photos](https://github.com/couzteau/Degoogle-Photos) with edge-case fixes applied on top (nested EXIF created-date, sidecar matching for `-edited`/`(N)` names, Live Photo sidecar inheritance, mislabeled `.heic`-as-video sniffing, rerun-safe resume) — which will hopefully be merged into the original repository.

## Why this exists

**If you're not paying for the product, you are the product.**

Google Photos is free because their business model is advertising and data. Their terms grant them a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, and distribute your uploads -- including AI training. Your "private" album is private from other users, not from Google.

I decided to leave. Google Takeout -- the only official export -- dumps your library into dozens of numbered zips: albums split across chunks, JSON metadata with truncated filenames, duplicates everywhere, no usable organization. For my ~20,000 photos across 46 archives, it was unusable.

The popular [Google Photos Takeout Helper](https://github.com/TheLastGimbus/GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper) crashed repeatedly on missing metadata fields with no resume support. After several rounds of whack-a-mole I gave up.

So I built this with Claude. Sharing it because leaving Google shouldn't require a computer science degree.

## Getting your photos out of Google

1. Go to [takeout.google.com](https://takeout.google.com)
2. Click **Deselect all**, then scroll down and select only **Google Photos**
3. Click **Next step**
4. Choose **Export once**, file type **.zip**, and size **2 GB** (or 50 GB if you have fast internet and lots of storage)
5. Click **Create export**
6. Wait -- Google prepares the archive in the background and emails you when it's ready (can take hours or even days for large collections)
7. Download all the zip files and extract them into a single folder

You'll end up with something like `Takeout/`, `Takeout-2/`, `Takeout-3/`, ... each containing a `Google Photos/` subfolder. That's your `--source` directory.

## What it does

**Takeout migration mode** (default):
- Scans multiple `Takeout*/Google Photos/` directories and builds a global index
- Extracts the best date for each file (EXIF > JSON photoTakenTime > filename > JSON creationTime > parent dir year)
- Deduplicates by MD5 hash + date (rounded to the minute)
- Copies media files into `YYYY/MM/` folders, preserving JSON sidecars alongside
  (`YYYY/unknown/` when only the year is known, `needs_review/` when nothing is)
- Creates `Albums/` folder with relative symlinks for named albums
- Generates a multi-page HTML report with thumbnails, metadata tooltips, and Finder links

**Dedup mode** (`--dedup-scan`):
- Scans any folder and its subdirectories for duplicate media files
- Copies one unique file per duplicate group into a date-organised `YYYY/MM/` structure
- Recreates the original folder tree under `by-folder/` as symlinks pointing at the date-organised files
- The source folder is never modified

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- A Google Takeout export (see above)

## Installation

This fork is not published on PyPI — install from the cloned GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sychu/Degoogle-Photos-Edge.git
cd Degoogle-Photos-Edge
pip install .
```

That's it. Pillow (for EXIF extraction) is installed automatically. The `degoogle-photos` command is then available on your PATH.

You can also run it straight from the clone without installing, using the module entry point:

```bash
python3 -m degoogle_photos.cli --source /path/to/takeouts --output /path/to/organized
```

## Usage

### Takeout migration

```bash
# Simplest: cd into the folder with your extracted Takeout dirs and run
cd /path/to/takeouts
degoogle-photos

# Or specify paths explicitly
degoogle-photos --source /path/to/takeouts --output /path/to/organized

# Preview what would happen (no files copied)
degoogle-photos --dry-run
```

The script is **safe to stop and restart** at any time. It detects files that have already been copied and skips them, so you'll never end up with duplicates — even if you run it multiple times or interrupt it halfway through.

### Dedup mode

Deduplicate one or more folders without needing a Takeout structure. Source folders are never modified — a clean, deduplicated copy is written to the output folder.

```bash
# Dry run first — see what would be copied and which groups are duplicates
python3 -m degoogle_photos.cli --dedup-scan --dry-run \
  --source "/path/to/photo backup" \
  --output /path/to/output

# Full run — copies unique files, source untouched
python3 -m degoogle_photos.cli --dedup-scan \
  --source "/path/to/photo backup" \
  --output /path/to/output

# Multiple source folders — deduplicated across all of them
python3 -m degoogle_photos.cli --dedup-scan \
  --source "/Volumes/Drive1/photos" "/Volumes/Drive2/old photos" \
  --output /path/to/output
```

**Output structure (single source):**
```
output/
  2019/07/IMG_001.jpg        ← unique file, date-organised
  2020/03/VID_001.mp4
  needs_review/IMG_nodate.jpg
  by-folder/                 ← original folder tree as symlinks
    vacation 2019/
      IMG_001.jpg  →  ../../2019/07/IMG_001.jpg
    birthday/
      VID_001.mp4  →  ../../2020/03/VID_001.mp4
  report/index.html
```

**Output structure (multiple sources):** `by-folder/` is prefixed with each source folder's name so trees don't collide:
```
output/
  2019/07/IMG_001.jpg
  by-folder/
    photos/                  ← from Drive1
      vacation/IMG_001.jpg  →  ../../2019/07/IMG_001.jpg
    old photos/              ← from Drive2
      2018/IMG_002.jpg      →  ../../2018/03/IMG_002.jpg
```

Within each duplicate group the file with the **shortest path** is kept; all others are skipped. Duplicates are detected across all source folders.

**Moving the output to another drive:** the `by-folder/` symlinks use relative paths, so they only work if the entire output folder travels as a unit. Copy it with `ditto` (macOS-native, recommended) or `rsync -a` — both preserve symlinks. Never copy `by-folder/` and the `YYYY/MM/` folders separately or the symlinks will break.

```bash
# Recommended
ditto "/Volumes/Ramrod/deduped collection" "/Volumes/NewDrive/deduped collection"

# Alternative
rsync -a --progress \
  "/Volumes/Ramrod/deduped collection/" \
  "/Volumes/NewDrive/deduped collection/"
```

> **If `degoogle-photos` is not found** on your PATH, use `python3 -m degoogle_photos.cli` in place of `degoogle-photos` in all commands above.

### All options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--source PATH [PATH ...]` | current directory | One or more source folders. For migration: root containing Takeout dirs. For `--dedup-scan`: any folders to scan. |
| `--output PATH` | `./DeGoogle-Edge Photos` | Destination for organised photos or dedup output |
| `--dry-run` | off | Report what would be done without copying any files |
| `--dedup-scan` | off | Dedup mode: scan any folder(s) instead of running a Takeout migration |

## How it works

### Takeout migration

1. **Index** — Scan all Takeout directories, index media files and JSON sidecars by album
2. **Match** — Link each media file to its JSON sidecar via title field or filename stripping. Videos without a sidecar inherit the same-stem Live Photo still's sidecar, and mislabeled `.heic`-named video files are detected by magic bytes and copied with their real `.mp4`/`.mov` name.
3. **Date extraction** — Extract the best date using a priority cascade (EXIF > JSON > filename > parent dir year)
4. **Deduplication** — Skip files with identical MD5 + date (within the same minute)
5. **Copy** — Copy to `YYYY/MM/filename` with collision resolution (`_2`, `_3`, etc.)
6. **Albums** — Create `Albums/<name>/` with relative symlinks to the copied files
7. **Report** — Generate a browsable HTML report with per-folder and per-album pages

### Dedup mode

1. **Scan** — Recursively find all media files across all `--source` folders
2. **Checksum** — Compute MD5 for every file; group identical files together (across all sources)
3. **Copy** — For each unique file (or duplicate group keeper), copy to `YYYY/MM/` using the same date-extraction cascade; name collisions get a `_2`, `_3` suffix
4. **Symlinks** — Recreate each source folder tree under `by-folder/` (namespaced by source folder name when multiple sources are given) with relative symlinks pointing at the date-organised copies
5. **Report** — Generate an HTML report listing all duplicate groups with COPIED / SKIPPED status per file

## HTML Report

The report is written to `<output>/report/index.html` and includes:

- Dashboard with copy/duplicate/error counts and date-source breakdown
- "Attention needed" section surfacing files in `needs_review/` and `YYYY/unknown/`
- Per-folder pages with image thumbnails in a responsive grid
- Per-album pages for named albums (generic "Photos from YYYY" albums are excluded)
- Hover tooltips showing EXIF data (camera, ISO, focal length, GPS) and JSON metadata (people, geo, description)
- "Finder" buttons to open the containing folder in macOS Finder

## Where to put your photos after

Once your photos are organized, you have options with better privacy terms:

### Recommended: Immich (self-hosted Google Photos replacement)

[Immich](https://immich.app/) is a free, open-source, self-hosted photo platform with face recognition, map view, timeline browsing, mobile apps, and AI-powered search -- all running on your own hardware. Your photos never leave your network. It's the closest thing to Google Photos without giving up your privacy.

Setup is quick -- it runs locally via [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and the [install guide](https://immich.app/docs/install/docker-compose) is straightforward. If you get stuck, any AI assistant can walk you through it in minutes. Once running, Immich's smart search (by face, location, object, or scene) fully replaces what you'd need Google Photos for when it comes to finding and sorting your photos.

After running degoogle-photos, create an API key in the Immich web UI (Account Settings > API Keys), then authenticate and upload:

```bash
immich login http://localhost:2283 YOUR-API-KEY
immich upload --recursive "/path/to/DeGoogle-Edge Photos"
```

Immich will pick up the dates and folder structure automatically.
